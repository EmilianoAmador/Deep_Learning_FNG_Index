# Unit_14_Deep_Learning_FNG_Index
In this activity we use Recurrent Neural Networks to model BTC closing prices. The objective is to create a model using tensorflow and keras to make predictions on future closing prices.  Then compare which training data will produce better testing results.



using small number of units comes out more accurate. tried 30 and 5 nou. 5 shows a graph with predicted closing prices more closely related to actual.
